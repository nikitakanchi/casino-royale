Player chooses between two sides either: 'banker' or 'player'. 
Player draws two cards initially and the one with the nearest number to 9 wins. 
Whenever sum overboards to 9, 1 card will be drawn from the deck. 
However, if the first two draw result in a sum of 8 and 9, the dealer won't draw an additional card anymore.
